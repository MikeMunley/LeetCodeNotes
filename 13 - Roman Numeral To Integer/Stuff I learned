Stuff I learned

1. the .charAt() method used to pinpoint a character in a string while using a for loop.

2. Designating a variable for a specifically placed character within a string (i + 1)

3. Don't be afraid to nest the hell out of if/else statements if you need to.

4. Using an object to declare the numerals as integers instead of trying to declare each one its own variable.

5. incrementing within an if statement to skip over an iteration in the for loop.
