So in this one I watched the Terrible Whitebard tutorial and he 
created an entire JS Class that would allow him to stack valid characters and wrote methods for each of them in order to 
allow him to push, pop, peek and check if the stack was empty.
Need to dig deeper into javascript classes.
He also used a for loop that only had one condition and broke the loop within the code of the loop when complete.
